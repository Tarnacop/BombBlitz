# Team Project- B.1 

##Git

####Git structure:
bomber.AI
bomber.UI
bomber.audio
bomber.game
bomber.networking
bomber.physics
bomber.renderer

####Working with git

After you clone the project for the first time do:
```
git checkout dev 

```
Then check the packages in which you are going to work and corresponding to that do: 
e.g. for physics
```
git branch physics
git checkout physics
```
When you fully implemented and tested one functional part of your tasks then do:
e.g. physics
```
git checkout dev
git merge physics
```
And always keep updated from the dev branch.
Make sure you are in your paticular branch e.g. networking and do:
```
git merge dev
```
